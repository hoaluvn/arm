@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density 
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density 
    Value line) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported 
    device and development board.    
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

1. Program the internal Flash with the IR_Decoding_PWMI (see below) " 
2. Choose a protocol from the list.
3. Press on the remote control to send a command.
      
In order to load the InfraRed code, you have do the following:
 - EWARM:
    - Open the IR_Decoding_PWMI.eww workspace
    - In the workspace toolbar select the infrared protocol:
        - IR_RC5_Decoder       : to configure the project for RC5 protocol.
        - IR_SIRC_Decoder      : to configure the project for SIRC protocol.
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
    - Load project image: Project->Debug
    - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)

 - RIDE:
    - Open the IR_Decoding_PWMI.rprj project
    - In the configuration toolbar(Project->properties) select the infrared protocol:
        - IR_RC5_Decoder       : to configure the project for RC5 protocol.
        - IR_SIRC_Decoder      : to configure the project for SIRC protocol.
    - Rebuild all files: Project->build project
    - Load project image: Debug->start(ctrl+D)
    - Run program: Debug->Run(ctrl+F9)

 - MDK-ARM:
    - Open the IR_Decoding_PWMI.uvproj project
    - In the build toolbar select the infrared protocol:
        - IR_RC5_Decoder       : to configure the project for RC5 protocol.
        - IR_SIRC_Decoder      : to configure the project for SIRC protocol.

    - Browse to open the IR_Decoding_PWMI.htp
        - IR_RC5_Decoder       : to configure the project for RC5 protocol.
        - IR_SIRC_Decoder      : to configure the project for SIRC protocol.
    - A "Download application" window is displayed, click "cancel".
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
    - Load project image : Click "ok" in the "Download application" window.
    - Run program: Debug->Run 

 - TrueSTUDIO:
    - Open the TrueSTUDIO toolchain.
    - Click on File->Switch Workspace->Other and browse to TrueSTUDIO workspace 
      directory.
    - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace' 
      and then click "Next". 
    - Browse to the TrueSTUDIO workspace directory and select the project: 
        - IR_RC5_Decoder       : to load the project for RC5 protocol.
        - IR_SIRC_Decoder      : to load the project for SIRC protocol.
    - Under Windows->Preferences->General->Workspace->Linked Resources, add 
      a variable path named "CurPath" which points to the folder containing
      "Libraries", "Project" and "Utilities" folders.
    - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" 
      window then click on Project->build project menu.
    - Run program: Select the project in the "Project explorer" window then click 
      Run->Debug (F11)
