@par Description

This application note shows how to implement a RC5 receiver by software using
STM32 microcontrollers. The demo consists of receiving RC5 messages and then sent
it to the hyperterminal. 
USART1 is used for this purpose to connect the board to the PC. Please configure the 
hyperterminal as the following:

 -  115200 baud,
 -  8-bit data,
 -  No parity,
 -  No Flow Control.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F10x High-Density, High-Density Value line, 
    Medium-Density, Connectivity line, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    High-Density Value line), STM32100B-EVAL(STM32F10x Medium-Density Value line), 
    STM3210B-EVAL (STM32F10x Medium-Density) and STM3210E-EVAL (STM32F10x High-Density) 
    evaluation boards. 
    The STM3210C-EVAL board (STM32F10x Connectivity Line) is not supported by the demo. 
    However Connectivity Line product supports the demo.
   
  - STM32100B-EVAL, STM3210B-EVAL, STM3210C-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
     - Connect the IR module output to GPIOB.01.
     - Connect the board (USART1) to the PC via RS232 cable.

  - STM32100E-EVAL Set-up 
     - Connect PC.06 to GPIOB.01 and use the IR module already available on board.
     - Connect the board (USART1) to the PC via RS232 cable.
